ðŸš€ We start with impact! Therefore we believe that there is no innovation without opening up to new points of view, ambition and thinking outside the box. ðŸ“¦ That's why we decided to start to provide open source code/projects!

ðŸ’ª Now we are starting to build our repository! Soon you will find here code and solutions that we endorse with our seal of quality ðŸ‘Œ, which can enhance your projects. Or you can enhance our proposals by enriching them with your unconventional concepts!

ðŸ‘‰ See what we already have to offer! ðŸ‘ˆ
Do you think our solutions are good? Check if we are looking for [you](https://www.inetum.com/en/jobs?f%5B0%5D=region:1058)!
